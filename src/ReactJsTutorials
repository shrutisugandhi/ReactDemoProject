Project reactDummy on counter increment/decrement
1.Reactjs project installation using create-react-app frontend pipeline
2.added bootstrap links into index.html
3.Flow of react
index.html(id="root")-->index.js-->app.js-->home.js/counter.js using function or classname as tags (
<Counter/>
or
<Home/>
)
4.React.fragment to remove unnecessary
<div>
tags
5.Ctrl+d for multicursor changes
6.Preetify/Simple React Snippets
7.State object for dynamic data display
state={
count:0
}
8.destructuring obj using const
const {count} =this.state;
9.Shift+alt+f =Format code for react.js
10.Styling using className static and dynamic
11. Dynamic rendering of classname on based of count value
12.Refracturing style class variable in a method
13.Rendering dynamically list of tags using map method
https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys
14.conditional rendering of list
15.Event handling and binding event handlers <button onClick={ this.increment }
   eg. increment method will be used asa arrow function
   increment=()=>{
}
instead of using constructor,bind method and super()
16.setState(objname) to modify value of object
17.Parameter on methods by using arrow function directly in onClick event handler of button
18.Composing components
19.Nested components
20.Parent to child data transfer
21.React Developer tools
22.State vs props
props passed data (input data) to component.It is readonly.Cant change value of props.To change props value assign to state
state :local to specific component cant access by another
23.Raising and handling events
Ex : Delete counter is done by using event onDelete from counter component to counterList i.e child to parent relationship
and using filter method of array to change state
24.Removing local state in child component to reset counter and creating only one state in parent .Thischild component is called controlled component.In this method child contain data through props and parent contain data through event handlers
25.Removing local state using counterAttr in parent component and using it in both parent and child files and accessing them in child by "props"
26.Lift the state up/Multiple components in sync means if two child  components need to interact but they dont have parent child relationship so concept of "lift the state up" is used in which state is moved to parent of both component
Example: navbar and counterlistwithcommonstate are child of app.js so app.js will have common state obj
27.Stateless functional compoennt means using funtion instead of class to render react compoentn
27.Lifecycle hooks
a. Mounting Phase :in this instance of react class is created and rendered on DOM
Methods used in Mounting Phase are:
constructor , render , compoentDidMount
b. Update Phase : In this props or state is updated
Methods :
render , componentDidUpdate
c. Unmounting phase : When compoent is delete from DOM like delete counter
Methods
componentWillUnmount
